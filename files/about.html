    <H2>About</H2>
    <p>
        I'm an aviation industry professional and business leader with almost 25 years of international experience working for private airline, major engine OEM and independent MRO. I speak English, my native is Russian, and am actively studying Finnish.

        Graduated from the Moscow State Technical University of Civil Aviation and hold both B.Sc. (1996) and M.Sc. (Hons., 1998) in Engineering and Technology with specialization in Operation of Aerospace Equipment.         
        
        Since 1997 I went through a few long-term projects and various positions at TRANSAERO Airlines (aircraft maintenance, powerplant engineering, and engine fleet management), at GE Aviation (field services and regional sales), and most recently at GA Telesis Engine Services (sales leadership and customer service).
        
        In 2020 I founded MORYAKOV.PRO, an independent aviation consulting company in Helsinki, with primary focus to provide assistance to smart and ambitious aviation companies, lessors and investors in aeroengine management.
